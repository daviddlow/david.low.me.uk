# Andy Warhol never came up with anything this good

This one was inspired... take the label off an Irn Bru bottle, which _just happens_ to be the same circumference as miniature scotch pies from our friends at Bell's Food Group?

Then stack just enough of them to make a can shape, and what do you know, you've got an Irn Bru can with a special flavour... better than that awful low-sugar rubbish they came out with!
