# Better than the film

Soemone at work challenged me to make "life of pie" since a similarly-named film was in vogue at the time.   Who was I to refuse? 

Some spare Lego, some cheap kitchenware and a scotch pie later, there we were.

Now look for the sequel, [Life of Pie 2](/pie-nation/2013/01/20/life-of-pie-2.html)
