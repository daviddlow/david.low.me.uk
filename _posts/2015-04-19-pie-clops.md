# It sounded better than it turned out

"Find a way to stick an eye in a pie because the Pie-clops name is too good" but unlike rubber dinosaurs, there weren't any spare eyes lying around the living room that day.  So the guts of a scotch egg went into a scotch pie!

Probably needed "double scotch" to find it funny, too.

Of course this is referring back to [Cyclops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopes) the mythical one-eyed Greek monster... in case you were wondering
